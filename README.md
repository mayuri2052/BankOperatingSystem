# BankOperatingSystem
Python project 

In master branch->Src has pyhton code and Documentation 

This project is a good example of object-oriented programming (OOP). The Bank_Account , Saving_Account and Current_Account classes are both objects that have their own properties and methods. The code is also modular, which makes it easy to understand and maintain.

This project is a good starting point for beginners who want to learn Python. It is relatively simple to understand and implement, but it still teaches some important OOP concepts.
